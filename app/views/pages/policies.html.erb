<h1>Policies</h1>
<h2>Spam</h2>
<p>Spam sucks. Don't do it. I'll ban you, personally, from participation in your teams. If your team spams people, I'll ban you all.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Privacy is pretty cool. I like privacy. On the other hand, David Brin was right: privacy is dead. This is the internet. See the policy on security.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>It's not robust.</p>

<p>I wrote my undergraduate thesis in cryptographic number theory. Which means I totally understand how lame most electronic security systems are. Including mine. Please don't be a lame hacker. Be awesome. If you break in, I expect you to fix things up and leave them better than you found them.</p>

<blockquote>Those who would sacrifice some liberty for the sake of security will soon lose both.</blockquote>

<p>Warning to users: your data is not secure. Not anywhere. Certainly not here. I rely on other service providers for the most part, and when I'm working on this project my focus is on features and bug-fixes - which generally means I'm not thinking much about keeping on top of the latest security protocols. Like most sites, I'm probably lagging sufficiently far behind the cutting edge in security that I'm leaving holes big enough for an enterprising hacker to drive a truck through. That said, I try to keep the prying eyes of unwarranted intruders off your bits. Haven't yet had to choose between crippling my service and serving China.</p>

<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>You may have noticed the feedback mechanism over on GetSatisfaction. If not, maybe that's just because you haven't created it yet. I'm showing up here to play with you, and I fully expect you to play too. Let's make something epic and win the Internet together.</p>

<h2>Identity</h2>
<p>I'd love to be able to be sure that the people participating on here are identifiably the same as the people they claim to be in meatspace. This is intended to be a space where people make real decisions, among and together with their associates, about what they'll do together in the world. That said, I'm not into forcing or enforcing identity. Get to know the people you're working with. Learn to know yourself. Trust the feelings you have about each other, and then learn from the feedback you get about that; it'll improve the quality of the information you get from similar feelings when you generate them in the future.</p>
