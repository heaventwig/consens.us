# consens.us: main site framework

This is the main web application to be run on consens.us. It is initially being written by [Gavin White](http://workplaydance.com/). This project will integrate with the openconsent project, which is being developed primarily by [Aptivate](http://aptivate.org).

This site (consens.us) is under contract for sale to a third party; this app will stop running on that site when the initial payment clears and the domain transfer is initiated.
